# How to Download the WordPress Theme

Since there's no "download folder" button, here are your options:

## Option 1: Manual File-by-File Download (Tedious but Works)

Download each file individually from the Files tab. Here's the complete list:

- `wordpress-theme/templates/archive.html`
- `wordpress-theme/templates/single.html`

### Part Files (2 files in /parts/):
- `wordpress-theme/parts/header.html`
- `wordpress-theme/parts/footer.html`

### CSS Files (4 files in /assets/css/):
- `wordpress-theme/assets/css/variables.css`
- `wordpress-theme/assets/css/base.css`

### JavaScript Files (6 files in /assets/js/):
- `wordpress-theme/assets/js/main.js`
- `wordpress-theme/assets/js/aura.js`
- `wordpress-theme/assets/js/categories.js`
- `wordpress-theme/assets/js/header-logo.js`
- `wordpress-theme/assets/js/posts.js`
- `wordpress-theme/assets/js/supabase-client.js`

### Image Files (12 files in /assets/images/):
- `wordpress-theme/assets/images/top-UP-olon-120.png`
- `wordpress-theme/assets/images/top-HOVER-olon-120.png`
- `wordpress-theme/assets/images/up-UP-olon-120.png`
- `wordpress-theme/assets/images/up-HOVER-olon-120.png`
- `wordpress-theme/assets/images/charm-UP-olon-120.png`
- `wordpress-theme/assets/images/charm-HOVER-olon-120.png`
- `wordpress-theme/assets/images/bottom-UP-olon-120.png`
- `wordpress-theme/assets/images/bottom-HOVER-olon-120.png`

## Option 2: Use Git Clone (If in Codespace/GitHub)

If this is a GitHub Codespace:
```bash
# In a local terminal on your machine:
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <repo-name>
tar -czf olon-sentiment-theme.tar.gz wordpress-theme/
```

---

## Option 3: Download via Terminal to Local (If SSH/Remote Access)

If you have SSH or remote access to this environment from your local machine:
```bash
# On your local machine:
scp -r user@host:/tmp/cc-agent/58620091/project/wordpress-theme ./
tar -czf olon-sentiment-theme.tar.gz wordpress-theme/
```

---

## Option 4: Use VS Code / IDE Features

If you're using VS Code, Cursor, or similar:
1. Right-click on the `wordpress-theme` folder
2. Look for "Download" option (may vary by IDE)
3. Or use the built-in terminal to create the archive

---

## Option 5: Copy All Files as Text

Since all files are text-based (except images), you can:
1. Copy each text file's content manually
2. For images, they're already duplicated in the root `images/` folder
3. Recreate the folder structure locally

---

## Recommended: Check Your Environment

What type of environment are you in?
- **GitHub Codespaces?** → Use git clone or VS Code download
- **Local IDE?** → Right-click folder → Download
- **Web-based IDE?** → Check for "Download project" or "Export" options
- **SSH/Remote?** → Use SCP or rsync
