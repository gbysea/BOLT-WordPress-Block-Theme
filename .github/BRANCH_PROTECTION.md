# Branch Protection Configuration

This document outlines the branch protection settings for the BOLT WordPress Block Theme repository.

## üõ°Ô∏è Protected Branches

### Main Branch (`main`)

**Protection Rules Applied:**
- ‚úÖ Require a pull request before merging
- ‚úÖ Require approvals: 1
- ‚úÖ Dismiss stale PR approvals when new commits are pushed
- ‚úÖ Require status checks to pass before merging
- ‚úÖ Require branches to be up to date before merging
- ‚úÖ Require conversation resolution before merging
- ‚úÖ Restrict pushes that create files larger than 100 MB
- ‚úÖ Include administrators (recommended for team projects)

## üîß Required Status Checks

The following automated checks must pass before merging:

### 1. Code Quality Checks (`code-quality`)
- **Large file detection** (>10MB)
- **WordPress theme structure validation**
- **CSS syntax checking**
- **JSON validation**

### 2. Security Scan (`security-scan`) 
- **Sensitive file detection**
- **Hardcoded secret scanning**
- **Security pattern analysis**

### 3. Accessibility Check (`accessibility-check`)
- **HTML template accessibility**
- **Alt text validation**
- **Heading structure check**

### 4. Deployment Readiness (`deployment-ready`)
- **Theme completeness verification**
- **Version checking**
- **Documentation validation**

## üöÄ Workflow for Contributors

### For External Contributors:
1. **Fork** the repository
2. **Create feature branch** from main
3. **Make changes** on feature branch
4. **Submit pull request** to main branch
5. **Wait for review** and status checks
6. **Address feedback** if needed
7. **Merge** after approval and passing checks

### For Maintainers:
1. **Create branch** from main for features
2. **Work on branch** (no direct pushes to main)
3. **Submit PR** even as maintainer
4. **Ensure all checks pass**
5. **Merge after review**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Emergency Procedures

### If Branch Protection Needs Bypass:
1. **Document reason** for bypass
2. **Get additional approval** from project owner
3. **Temporarily disable protection** if absolutely necessary
4. **Re-enable protection** immediately after
5. **Review changes** made during bypass

### Hot Fixes:
1. **Create hotfix branch** from main
2. **Make minimal changes** only
3. **Fast-track PR review**
4. **Merge and tag release**
